# Importing GEDCOM Files #

When you import GEDCOM files into Legado, one mistake I have made is that when I went to see the Pedigree by clicking in the pedigree button. I didn't see anything. This might be a bug that need to be fixed.
However, that doesn't mean that the file wasn't  imported properly. In order to see the pedigree all you have to do is click on the Family Trees drop down menu and then select your family tree. This should reset the previous view and show the pedigree of the newly imported gedcom file.
