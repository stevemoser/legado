This project is based on Gramps. It added the functionality to be able to connect to the FamilySearch API.

Please email me any questions or if you need any help setting it up.

As of February 15th 2011 all new changes have been committed. You need a developer key from the church to access the api as well as a username and password. Let me know if you can't get this and we can figure something out.
